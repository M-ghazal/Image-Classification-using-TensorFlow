# Image-Classification-with-Convolutional-Neural-Networks
This project implements an image classification model using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with TensorFlow and Keras. The model is trained to classify images into two categories using a dataset of labeled images. The training pipeline includes data augmentation, regularization, and performance evaluation using various metrics.
